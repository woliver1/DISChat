# DISChat
Chat client using the DIS protocol

This is a chat program that uses the DIS comment PDU for sending and receiving chat messages.

DIS is widely used in the simulation community and the use of the DIS protocol will hopefully allow a simple
but reliable chat system to use during simulation exercises.

I have never progrmmed in Java so this is likely be pretty poor initially.
